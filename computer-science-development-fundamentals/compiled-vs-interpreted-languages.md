# Compiled vs Interpreted Languages

Compiled and interpreted languages represent two different approaches to translating and executing code written by programmers. Hereâ€™s an overview of each, along with their key differences, advantages, and disadvantages:

## Compiled Languages

| Aspect              | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | Source code is translated into machine code by a compiler. The resulting machine code can be executed directly by the computer's hardware.           |
| **Examples**        | C, C++, Rust, Go                                                                                                                                     |
| **Process**         | 1. Write source code. <br> 2. Compile source code into machine code (executable file). <br> 3. Execute machine code.                                     |
| **Advantages**      | - High performance due to direct execution of machine code.<br>- Optimizations performed by the compiler.<br>- No runtime overhead.                 |
| **Disadvantages**   | - Compilation can be time-consuming.<br>- Machine code is platform-dependent.<br>- Debugging can be complex.                                        |

## Interpreted Languages

| Aspect              | Description                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | Source code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, translating it into machine code on the fly.                         |
| **Examples**        | Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP                                                                                                           |
| **Process**         | 1. Write source code.<br>2. Interpreter reads and executes source code line-by-line.                                                    |
| **Advantages**      | - High portability across different platforms.<br>- Easier debugging due to immediate error handling.<br>- Support for interactive execution environments (REPLs). |
| **Disadvantages**   | - Slower performance due to runtime translation.<br>- Added runtime overhead from the interpreter.<br>- Source code cannot run without the interpreter. |

### Mixed Approaches

| Language | Description                                                                                                                            |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Java** | Source code is compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler. The JVM then interprets or just-in-time compiles the bytecode at runtime.   |
| **Python**| Source code is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Python interpreter.                                      |
