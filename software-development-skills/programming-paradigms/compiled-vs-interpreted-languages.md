## Introduction

Understanding the distinction between compiled and interpreted languages is crucial in programming, as it affects performance, portability, and ease of debugging.

## Key Concepts

- **Compiled Language**: Translates source code into machine code before execution.
- **Interpreted Language**: Executes instructions directly without prior compilation.

## Differences Between Compiled and Interpreted Languages

| **Aspect**       | **Compiled Languages**                     | **Interpreted Languages**               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Translation**  | Translated entirely before execution       | Translated line-by-line during execution|
| **Execution**    | Faster due to prior compilation            | Slower due to on-the-fly interpretation |
| **Portability**  | Less portable, depends on target machine   | More portable across different systems  |
| **Debugging**    | More difficult to debug                    | Easier to debug with direct execution   |

## Examples

### Example 1: Compiled Language (C#)

C# is a compiled language where the code is translated into intermediate language (IL) and then to machine code by the .NET runtime.

```csharp
using System;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Interpreted Language (Python)

Python is an interpreted language where the code is executed line-by-line by the Python interpreter.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Compiled Languages

- **Advantages**:
  - Faster execution
  - Optimization by the compiler
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Longer compile time
  - Platform-dependent binaries

### Interpreted Languages

- **Advantages**:
  - Easier debugging and testing
  - Greater portability
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slower execution
  - Potential runtime errors

## Summary

Compiled and interpreted languages each have unique benefits and trade-offs. Understanding these can help in selecting the appropriate language for a given application based on performance, portability, and ease of use.
