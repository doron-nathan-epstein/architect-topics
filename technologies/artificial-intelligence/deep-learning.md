# Deep Learning

**Definition**:
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with many layers (hence "deep" learning). These networks can automatically learn and extract features from raw data through a process called representation learning. Deep learning has proven particularly effective for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

## Key Concepts

1. **Neural Networks**:
   - **Artificial Neurons**: Basic units of a neural network, inspired by biological neurons. They receive inputs, apply weights, sum the results, pass them through an activation function, and produce an output.
   - **Layers**: Neural networks are composed of layers of neurons:
     - **Input Layer**: Receives the raw input data.
     - **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that perform computations and feature extraction.
     - **Output Layer**: Produces the final output (e.g., class probabilities).

2. **Activation Functions**:
   - Functions applied to the output of neurons, introducing non-linearity into the network. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Sigmoid, and Tanh.

3. **Forward Propagation**:
   - The process by which input data is passed through the network layer by layer to produce an output.

4. **Backpropagation**:
   - The process used to train the network by adjusting weights. It involves calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, and then updating the weights to minimize the loss.

5. **Loss Function**:
   - A function that measures how well the network's predictions match the actual target values. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks and Cross-Entropy Loss for classification tasks.

6. **Optimization Algorithms**:
   - Algorithms used to minimize the loss function by adjusting the network's weights. Popular optimization algorithms include Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Adam.

## Architectures

1. **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)**:
   - The simplest type of neural network where connections between nodes do not form cycles. Often used for basic tasks like classification and regression.

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**:
   - Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.

3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**:
   - Designed for sequential data. They maintain a hidden state that captures information about previous elements in the sequence. Variants include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, which address issues like vanishing gradients.

4. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:
   - Consist of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained simultaneously. The generator creates fake data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. This setup is used to generate realistic synthetic data.

5. **Transformer Networks**:
   - Initially developed for natural language processing tasks, transformers rely on attention mechanisms to process input data. They have since been adapted for other tasks such as image processing.

## Applications

1. **Computer Vision**:
   - Image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and style transfer.

2. **Natural Language Processing**:
   - Machine translation, sentiment analysis, text generation, and question answering.

3. **Speech Recognition**:
   - Transcribing spoken language into text, voice-controlled assistants.

4. **Game Playing**:
   - Deep reinforcement learning has been used to achieve superhuman performance in games like Go, Chess, and video games.

5. **Healthcare**:
   - Medical image analysis, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.
