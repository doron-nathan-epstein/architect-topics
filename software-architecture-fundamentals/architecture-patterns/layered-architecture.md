## Introduction

Layered Architecture, also known as N-Tier Architecture, is a software design pattern where the system is organized into multiple layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality.

## Key Concepts

- **Layered Architecture**: Organizes software into distinct layers based on responsibilities.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer focuses on a specific set of tasks, promoting modularity.
- **Communication Between Layers**: Defined interfaces for communication between layers.

## Layers in Layered Architecture

1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Handles user interaction and presentation logic.
   - Often includes user interfaces (UI) and presentation services.

2. **Business Logic Layer**:
   - Contains business rules and processes.
   - Implements the core functionality of the application.

3. **Data Access Layer**:
   - Manages data persistence and storage.
   - Interfaces with databases or external data sources.

4. **Infrastructure Layer** (optional):
   - Provides supporting services such as logging, configuration, and external integrations.

## Advantages of Layered Architecture

- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns enhances maintainability and scalability.
- **Flexibility**: Easier to update and replace individual layers without affecting others.
- **Security**: Access to sensitive data and business logic can be controlled at each layer.
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently, facilitating unit testing.

## Disadvantages of Layered Architecture

- **Complexity**: Increased architectural complexity compared to monolithic or simpler patterns.
- **Performance Overhead**: Communication between layers can introduce latency.
- **Rigid Structure**: Changing requirements may necessitate modifications across multiple layers.
- **Deployment Complexity**: Coordinating changes across layers during deployment can be challenging.

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise Applications**: Complex systems with distinct functional areas (e.g., ERP systems).
- **Scalable Systems**: Applications requiring scalability and maintainability over time.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Systems needing clear separation of regulatory or security concerns.

## Summary

Layered Architecture (N-Tier) provides a structured approach to designing complex software systems by dividing functionality into layers with well-defined responsibilities. Understanding its key concepts, advantages, disadvantages, use cases, and considering its implications for software design is crucial for architects and developers aiming to build scalable and maintainable applications.
